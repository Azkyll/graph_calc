# Simple graphic calculator for the refined egirl

## Graphic calculator in development, using SFML 2.5.1.

This project is part of a series of programs coded as an artistic performance. It started with a simple traditional console calculator, and I'm adding more functionality to it progressively, making a different project for each step.\
The **end goal** of it all is to build a minimalistic music production software intended for _**private**_ use. I do not yet know if it will be open-source.

## Current functionality
Well nothing. I broke it. Stay tuned.

What **SHOULD** it do?
  Create function objects from input streams and draw them on the current window.

What **WILL** it eventually (hopefully) do?
  Allow the user to create, draw and manually handle functions, both using in-window keyboard input to interact with the functional/mathematical object, and the mouse to interact with the curve of the function. It will also eventually be linked to a sampler.

## TODO
  - implement creation of functions using operations (i.e. cos(x + 1) or sin + cos)
  - expand and make a full GUI
