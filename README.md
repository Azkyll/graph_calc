# Simple graphic calculator for the refined transwoman

## Graphic calculator in development, using SFML 2.5.1.

This project is part of a series of programs coded as an artistic performance. It started with a simple traditional console calculator, and I'm adding more functionality to it progressively, making a different project for each step.\
The **end goal** of it all is to build a minimalistic music production software intended for _**private**_ use. I do not yet know if it will be open-source.

Right now it doesn't work. I broke some features trying to add new ones. Don't worry tho, I'll make it back.

## TODO
  - unbreak this thing !!!
  - get some rest
  - expand and make a full GUI
